- buffon- importance of father of evo
- Similarities between different organisms were well known and a source of fascination.
- farmers had known for millennia, crops- better yield etc
- Many have tried to explain 
- Nobody knew why

### Morphology varies in a continuous way:

---

### Most phenotypes are complex:

- Recap
- Morphology depends on inheritance of genes. 
 -Therefore, understanding the theory of evolution via natural selection requires understanding the genotype–phenotype distinction. 
- Hence it is crucial to get unbiased samples from wild. 
- Analysing Difficulty in both aspects:
  - How do we get a random sample of the population? 
  - One strategy is to collect inseminated females from the wild and to establish a population. Most laboratory strains were established in this way. canton s, oregon k oregon r. 
- However, for complex phenotypes that vary in multi-dimension, precise quantification of the phenotype can be difficult.
- On left: we see variation between species of genus Bia of Lepidoptera
- On the right we see variation within a species of Arabidopsis thaliana in response to different altitudes.

- Anisotrophy
- known
- all regions of morphospace not occupied
- pairs of legs always odd
- dev bias

### Overlap in morphospace:

- ICB28, ICB32 etc are significantly more similar to *D.suzukii* etc.
- Some lines vary more, some less.
- Some lines deviate more from Gaussian distribution
- Phenotype is stable after 6 years

Unique opportunity to compare genotype to pixel-by-pixel level resolution.

System in which we can compare between species and population
